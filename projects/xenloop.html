<h1>
XenLoop : A Transparent Inter-VM Network Loopback Channel
</h1>

<p>
Advances in virtualization
technology have focused mainly
on strengthening the isolation barrier
between  virtual machines (VMs) that
are co-resident within a single
physical machine.
At the same time, there exist a large category of
communication intensive distributed
applications and software components, such as 
web services, high
performance grid applications, transaction
processing, and graphics rendering,
that often wish to communicate
across this isolation barrier with
other endpoints on co-resident VMs.
State of the art inter-VM communication
mechanisms do not adequately address the
requirements of such applications.
TCP/UDP based network
communication tends to perform
poorly when used between co-resident VMs,
but has the advantage of being
transparent to user applications.
Other solutions exploit
inter-domain shared memory mechanisms
to improve communication latency and
bandwidth, but require applications
or user libraries to be rewritten against
customized APIs -- something not
practical for a large majority of
distributed applications.
In this project, we have developed
a fully transparent and high performance inter-VM
network loopback channel, called <b><i>XenLoop</i></b>,
in the Xen virtual machine environment.
XenLoop does not sacrifice either user or kernel-level 
transparency and yet achieves high communication 
performance between co-resident guest VMs.
XenLoop intercepts outgoing network packets 
and sheperds the packets destined to
co-resident VMs through a high-speed inter-VM
shared memory channel that bypasses the
virtualized network interface.
Guest VMs using XenLoop can migrate transparently across
machines without disrupting ongoing
network communications, and seamlessly switch
between the standard network path and the XenLoop channel.
In evaluation using a number of unmodified benchmarks,
we observe that XenLoop can reduce the inter-VM round trip
latency by up to a factor of 5 and
increase bandwidth by up to a factor of 6.

<h2> Frequently Asked Questions </h2>
Q: Does XenLoop work with "routed" mode networking configuration?
<br> 
Ans:
<pre>
	Likely not yet. We've tested it only in "bridged" mode.
	Routed mode might need some more code changes. 
	Suggestions welcome!
</pre>

Q: I get the following error on Xen 3.1
<pre>
ERROR xf_connect: line 198: HYPERVISOR_grant_table_op failed ret = -1 status = 0
ERROR: Exiting xf_connect
ERROR xf_connect: line 198: HYPERVISOR_grant_table_op failed ret = -1 status = 0
ERROR: Exiting xf_connect
</pre>
Ans:
<pre>
	By default, 3.1 doesn't seem to allow two unprivileged domains to
	share memory (for some obscure reasons).
	I understand this had apparently been fixed, but
	they left some unnecessary permission checks in
	xen/common/grant_table.c in the xen hypervisor.
	Edit this file and comment out all the occurences of
	the following lines

	       if ( unlikely(!grant_operation_permitted(d)) )
		   goto out;

	mostly in do_grant_op function

	Then recompile and reinstall the xen hypervisor (recompiling the
	guest is not necessary)

	These changes are not needed from Xen 3.2 onwards.
</pre>

Q: If i try to rmmod xenloop, I see lots of 
<pre>
   "WARNING: g.e. still in use!" 
</pre>
 messages on the guest domain with lower Xen domain ID.
<br> <br>
Ans:
<pre>
	Yes, this is an annoying, but benign, warning message. It happens 
	if the listener end of XenLoop (with lower domid) revokes page grants 
	before the connector end disconnects. It seems to be benign as long
	as both endpoints dissociate from each other. We haven't yet found a 
	perfectly clean way to synchronize the two endpoints so that connector 
	disconnects before listener revokes. We believe you can ignore 
	these messages for now.
