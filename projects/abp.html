<h1>Wireless Ad Hoc Rouing Without Explicit Control Messages</h1>

<p>
In this work, we investigate techniques for ad hoc wireless routing
without explicit control messages. 
We develop a new wireless ad hoc routing
protocol called Ad hoc Bridging Protocol (ABP). ABP distinguishes
itself from earlier proposals in that it uses no explicit
control messages for route discovery, setup, and maintenance,
while making minimal use of implicit (data-like) control messages
that require no special processing at intermediate nodes. ABP is
inspired from the self-learning plug-and-play nature of traditional
transparent bridges in wired LANs. Like wired bridges
and many earlier ad hoc protocols, nodes in ABP learn and
adapt routes to different destinations on-the-fly by observing the
packets sent by those destinations. As a result, ABP is completely
decentralized, self-starting, and automatically adapts to varying
network conditions. However, a major difference is that ABP does
not attempt to prevent routing loops at all costs. Consequently,
ABP does not construct or maintain any overarching control
infrastructure for loop prevention, such as extensive network-wide
spanning trees in traditional LAN bridges, destination
sequence numbers in AODV, or source-routing in DSR. The
essential idea is to couple the backward learning technique from
transparent bridging, with an associated refresh mechanism, and
the use of an identification field to effectively limit the impact of
any transient loops. We also prove that transient loops, if and
when they occur, do not last longer than a bounded, short time
interval and do not negatively impact the network performance.
Results demonstrate that, even without explicit control messages,
ABP can perform competitively in comparison to AODV and DSR
protocols while significantly reducing the protocol complexity.
