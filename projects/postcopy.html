<h1>Post-Copy Based Live Migration of Virtual Machines</h1>

<p>
In this project, we have designed, implemented, and evaluated 
a <i>Post-Copy</i>
based approach for the live migration of virtual machines
(VMs) across a gigabit LAN. Live migration is a pervasive feature
of modern hypervisors. It facilitates server consolidation, system
maintenance, and lower power consumption. Post-copy refers
to the deferral of the memory-copy phase of live migration until
after the VM's CPU state has been migrated to the target node. This
is in contrast to the traditional <i>pre-copy</i> approach, which first copies
the memory state over multiple iterations followed by the transfer
of CPU execution state. The post-copy strategy provides a win-win
by reducing the <i>total migration time</i> while maintaining the 
liveness benefits of the pre-copy approach. We facilitate
the use of post-copy with a specific instance of adaptive prepaging
(also known as adaptive remote paging). Pre-paging eliminates all
duplicate page transmissions and quickly removes any residual dependencies
for the migrating VM from the source node. Our prepaging
algorithm is able to reduce the number of page faults across
the network to 17% of the VM's working set. Finally, we enhance
both the original pre-copy and post-copy schemes with the use of a
dynamic, periodic self-ballooning (DSB) strategy, which prevents
the migration daemon from transmitting unnecessary free pages
in the guest OS. DSB significantly speeds up both the pre-copy and
post-copy migration schemes with very negligible performance 
degradation to the processes
running within the VM. We have implemented the post-copy approach
in the Xen VM environment and showed that it significantly
reduces the total migration time and network overheads across a
range of real-world VM workloads when compared against 
the traditional pre-copy approach.
