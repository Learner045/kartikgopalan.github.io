<H1>Configuring and Compiling the Linux Kernel</H1>
<ol>
	<li> Download a copy of latest kernel source code (say 4.4.1)
	<pre>
	$ wget https://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/v4.x/linux-4.4.1.tar.gz
	</pre>

	<li> Extract the kernel source tree from the downloaded file. For example, if you downloaded the tar.xz file, then execute 
	<pre>
	$ tar xvf linux-4.4.1.tar.gz
	</pre>
	
	<li> Configure the kernel:
	<pre>
	$ make localmodconfig
	</pre>

	<p>The "make localmodconfig" step allows you to customize the kernel configuration with the default configulation used by the currently running kernel image. The downloaded kernel comes in a default configuration, determined by the people who put together the kernel source code distribution. It will include support for nearly everything, since it is intended for general use, and is huge. It will take a long time to compile and a long time to load. The "localmodconfig" option only picks the options needed for the current hardware/software components on your machine.

	<p> If you are curious, you may want to explore an alternative command: "make menuconfig".
	<ul>
		<li>It will present you with a series of menus, from which you will choose the options you want to include. For most options you have three choices: (blank) leave it out; (M) compile it as a module, which will only be loaded if the feature is needed; (*) compile it monolithically into the kernel, so it will always be there from the time the kernel first loads. 
		<li>If you try this option, MAKE SURE that you reduce the size of the kernel, by leaving out unnecessary components. A small kernel will take less time to compile and less time to load. It will also leave more memory for you to use, resulting in less page swapping and faster compilations.
		<li>Retain ONLY the modules necessary to use the hardware installed on your system. To do this without including just about everything conceivable, you need to know what hardware is installed on your system. Use the commands lspci, dmesg, or check the file /var/log/syslog to determine your computer's hardware configuration.
		<li> Before exiting the final menu level and saving the configuration, it is also a good idea to save it to a named file, using the "Save Configuration to an Alternate File" option. By saving different configurations under different names you can reload a configuration without going through all the menu options again.
	</ul>
	<p><br>

	<li> Compile the kernel:
	<pre>
	$ make bzImage
	</pre>
	<p>The command will compile the kernel and create a compressed binary image of the kernel. The kernel image can be found at arch/x86/boot/bzImage (for a x86 based processor).
	<p><br>

	<li> Compile the kernel modules:
	<pre>
	$ make modules
	</pre>
	<p>This command will compile the dynamically loadable kernel modules you have selected in the configuration step. The result will be creation of .ko files for each module. For example, if you chose to compile the network device driver for the Realtek 8139 card as a module, the `driver/net/' directory will contain a file with the name 8139too.ko.
	<p><br>

	<li> Install the compiled kernel and modules as root as follows:
	<pre>
	$ sudo make modules_install
	$ sudo make install
	</pre>
	<p>The "make modules_install" and "make install" steps need to be done as root, since they write into system directories (/boot and /lib/modules). The kernel image (bzImage) is copied into /boot, and has a name starting with "vmlinuz" and including the version number. The modules go into a sub-directory of /lib/modules named after the version number.
	<p><br>

	<li> Reboot the system into your new kernel.
	<pre>
	$ sudo reboot
	</pre>

	<li>After your VM reboots, check if your new kernel is loaded.
	<pre>
	$ uname -a
	</pre>
